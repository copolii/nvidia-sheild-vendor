Subject: [PATCH] frameworks: native: add extra dalvik heap configs

Add new heap configuration for devices that have Cardhu and Enterprise like
attributes.
Currently, in JB the performance of apps like Gallery takes a hit with a heap
size of 48M on both Cardhu and Enterprise. Increasing this size to 64M in order
to accomodate excessive memory requests from an app.

Bug 1036662
